## Config

### theme

 main theme css settings are in `theme.json`

`[regular].js` is where the app routing is

 `socials.json` is where you can add/delete social icons. Just add or delete the URL in the file to turn them off or on

`next-sitemap.config.js` is where the sitemap and robots.txt settings are.  Built with [Next-Sitemap](https:/www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap)  `note:  edit .env.local and add your site url (https://my.cooldomain.io)` `note2: On Vercel, you have to modify your build settings so this works right.  "next build && next-sitemap"  is the right build command`
