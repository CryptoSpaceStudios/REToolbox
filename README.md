## Config

main theme css settings are in `theme.json`

the app routing is in`[regular].js` 

`socials.json` is where you can add/delete social icons. Just add or delete the URL in the file to turn them off or on

[`next-sitemap.config.js` is where the sitemap and robots.txt settings are](https:/www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap)

**`If you are using vercel, this variable autopopulates so sitemap gen works automatically on deployment`**

**`On Vercel, you have to modify your build settings so this works right. "next build && next-sitemap" is the right build command`**

### Social Icons

All these come pre-configured in `socials.json`.

Just simply add your personal URL to the json file and the icon will ✨ automagically appear ✨
